This is a little different.  In this example information is already in the function and then once the function does its calculations it sends the information back to the main program.

Lets look at the program to the left.  This time `FindSalary()` function does not take anything but returns the amount that can be afforded for the monthly payment.  This may not be as realistic as the previous example but in some other situations it is. 

Notice the parenthesis are empty. Instead in this one there is a return that sends the information back to the main part of the program.
