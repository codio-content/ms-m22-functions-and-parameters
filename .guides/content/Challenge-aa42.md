## Requirements
You can choose how to write your program from 3 of the 4 different ways to write it. 

- yes parameter, no return - function received data but doesn't return any data
- no parameter, yes return - function doesn't receive anything but returns some data
- yes parameter, yes return - function receives data and returns data 

So you must have either a parameter, a return, or both; however it is up to you. 

## Program

You are going to write a program that prints out the letter grade for the average you have.  So if you have a 95 the program would print out A, 81 it would print out B etc.  If you want to use a different scale just make sure that it in the comments.

You will need:
- to write a function that handles figuring out the letter grade.  You will need an `if, elif, elif, elif, else` statement to check the average and give the grade.
 - if you are doing a parameter pass in the average to the program
 - if you are doing a return then return the letter to the main program. 
 - if you want to do both (parameter & return) that is fine as well
 - your main program will mostly handle calling the function and maybe passing the average and/or receiving the grade.

*Since this does not grade itself please advise your teacher when completed and they can review your final program.*
