This is a little different.  In this example information is given to the function and then it does whatever it needs. 

Maybe it is a function that takes to numbers (parameters) and then within the function it prints them out added.  So it doesn't return anything. 

Lets look at the program to the left.  It is our `FindSalary()` function but this time the amount of hours is being sent to the function.  This is a more realistic use because every employee of a company could make the same amount but have different bills.  Then each of them could use this function and just send in their own bill amount. 

Notice the bill variable is in the parenthesis.  It is passed to the function so that the function can use it.
